L5BCalculator Users Guide

Welcome to the L5B Calculator!  This guide will helpfully make things easier
to use and understand.  

Reverse Polish Notation
=======================
First, you need to understand that this uses Reverse Polish Notation.  So instead
of entering: 2 + 2 =, you would do: 2 [ENTER] 2 [ENTER] + =.

Entering Numbers
=============
There is a box at the top of the screen that you can type into.  Or you can use
the number buttons for input.  You have to press [ENTER] to put the number on the 
stack.  

Entering the Operation
======================
When you are done entering the numbers, then push the operation, which is one of
+ - / * REM SQRT.

Executing the Operation
=======================
Now press the = button to get the result.  This will display in the message line
below the input box. 

16-Bit Half Float
=================
This calculator uses 16-bit HalfFloat, which can produce some interesting result.
For example: 1 + 1 = 2.000244

Limits
======
The maximum size you can enter is 65535.99, which the calculator rounds to 
65504.0.  If you enter 65535.999, the result is Infinity.
The maximum negative number you can enter is -65535.99, which is rounded to
65504.0.
The minimum number you can enter is 0.0000001 (6 zeros in front of the 1)
which displays as 1.1920929E-7.

Examples
========
1 ENTER 1 ENTER + = -> 2.000244
2 ENTER 3 ENTER - = -> -1.000122
10000 ENTER SQRT = -> 100.0
63 ENTER 9 ENTER / = -> 

Computer Registers
=================
There are 6 boxes at the bottom of the screen, 2 in the first row and 
4 in the next.

The first box, called IN, is the Input from the user.  This is always 
zero, because the contents are immediately moved to A.  (In a future version
this may be removed).
The 2nd box in the first row is called D. This contains the bytecode
of the next operation that will be executed.
The bottom row contains the stack, in boxes A, B, and C.  The value displayed
is the hexadecimal value of the 16-bit number that is there.  When numbers
are entered, the contents of A moves to B and B moves to C.
The last box, E, is the last operation entered.  So D moves to E. (This 
doesn't seem too useful and it may be removed).
